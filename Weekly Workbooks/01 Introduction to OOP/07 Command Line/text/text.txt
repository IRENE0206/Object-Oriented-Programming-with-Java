In this workbook, we have spent the majority of the time exploring the use of IntelliJ.
At this stage however, it is worth spending a little bit of time taking a look at how we can build and run
Maven projects on the command line. This is important because the assessed exercises later on in the
unit will be marked on the command line and you need to be able to make sure that your code will actually build and run.

On your command line, change into the project root folder (the directory where the `pom.xml` file resides) and type one of the following commands (depending on your platform):

    Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw clean compile
    Windows:     mvnw clean compile

**Note**: On some unix systems, you _might_ need to make `mvnw` executable first
(i.e. by running `chmod +x mvnw`)

The command is doing 2 separate things in sequential order:

1. `clean` ensure that everything will be freshly built by cleaning out (deleting) all previously generated files
2. `compile` compiles and builds all files and resources (stopping if any build errors occur)

Note that you can learn more about these and other build tasks in the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html">Maven documentation</a>.

The first time you run this command, it might take a while to complete so be patient. This is because Maven may need to download project dependencies from the web (obviously if you haven't got a working internet connection Maven may well fail at this point !)
If successful, the output should looks something like this:

    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Total time: 42 s
    [INFO] Finished at: 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get a `BUILD FAILURE`, it means the project failed to complete some of the specified tasks.
If this is the case, it might make sense to go back into IntelliJ and make sure no code issues are detected
(i.e. no code is highlighted in red and the project can still be built and run).
Fix any problems in IntelliJ and then return to the command line.

Once you have successfully built your code on the command line, you can run your program using:

    Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw exec:java
    Windows:     mvnw exec:java

Note that if you run the above command inside this week's project folder, Maven will run the `main` method from the `Shapes` class. Note that if you want to run the main method of _another_ class,
you can edit the project's `pom.xml` file and change the `mainClass` to be the desired class.
