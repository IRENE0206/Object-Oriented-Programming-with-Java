If when attempting to compile your code, you get a warning about version 17 source code,
you will probably need to update the `POM.xml` file in the project folder.
Run `java -version` on the command line to find out which version of Java you have installed
on your operating system. The template project was created assuming you have Java version 17
installed on your computer, if your version number differs, update the `maven.compiler.source`
and `maven.compiler.target` lines of the `POM.xml` file with your Java version number
(then try compiling again !)
