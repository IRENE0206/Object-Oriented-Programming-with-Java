In the previous teaching block, you learnt to program in C (to varying degrees of success ;o). In this unit however, you will be using **Java** and as such the _organisation_ of your code _should_ be very different. There are a number of key concepts that are fundamental to **Object Oriented** code. Before we progress to any hands-on practical exercises, it is important that you have an appreciation of these concepts. View the slides and video above to gain an understanding of these characteristics of Object Oriented code. At this stage, we only introduce the concepts at a very high level - we will revisit them again in later workbooks.
