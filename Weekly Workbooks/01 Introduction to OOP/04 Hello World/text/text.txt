The first program that you write in _most_ languages is "Hello World". Take a look at the slides and video above that describe "Hello World" in Java.
Once you understand the description of the code, create a new project in IntelliJ and then add a new Java Class called `HelloWorld` to the `src` folder
(by right-clicking on the `src` folder in the project view and selecting `New > Java Class`).
Now add some code to your class by copy-and-pasting the code from the above slide into your new Java Class (make sure you save it !).
Finally run the code you have added by clicking on the `Run` top-bar menu and selecting `Run...`.
After you have selected your main class (there should only be one to choose from !), there will be a short delay as IntelliJ compiles and runs your code.
If everything is successful you should see something like the screenshot below.
Make sure your code compiles and runs correctly before moving on to the next task in this workbook.
