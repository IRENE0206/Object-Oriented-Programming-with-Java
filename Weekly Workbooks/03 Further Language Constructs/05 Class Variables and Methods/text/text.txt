In the previous task, we counted the number of `Triangles` in the array by looping through it.
But there is an alternative way to achieve the same objective (without putting code inside the main loop).
We could maintain a counter of how many `Triangles` have been created _inside_ the Triangle class
and increment this each time a Triangle is instantiated.
This would encapsulate the "population" count inside the class itself - which is nice.

But there is a problem this with approach - we only want _one_ counter for the whole program
(not a counter inside _each and every_ `Triangle` instance). For this reason, we can't just use a "normal" variable.
View the slides and audio narration above to gain an understanding of the difference
between **instance** and **class** variables. Then add an integer **class** variable to your `Triangle` class to
keep track of how many `Triangles` have been created. Once you have declared with variable, you can update your
`Triangle` constructor method so that the counter is incremented each time a new `Triangle` is created.
You should also add a `getPopulation` method to your `Triangle` class that returns the current value of this
counter variable, so that it can be accessed from outside the class.

Update your main method, so that it prints out the number of `Triangles` that exist using
this class variable population counter _as well as_ the previous counter from inside the loop
(just to make sure both counters agree !)

Just as we can create **class variables** that are associated with the class (rather than each instance),
we can also write **class methods** which are similarly associated with the class (rather than the instances).
You have already encountered just such a class method (namely the `random` method of the `Math` class).
Have a think about the reasons why you might wish to write a class method, rather than an instance method.
Considering the `Triangle` class - might some of its methods be better suited to being class methods,
rather than instance methods ?
